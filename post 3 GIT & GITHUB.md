# GIT 

## Basic principles

It's a tool that can save your project if you messed it up. That mechanism is called "Version Control". 

You can see it as a rope in rock climbing. It can bring you back to a state you were before and start over again if you felt like you took a wrong direction. Another good picture is the "Time Machine".

You can work on multiple **branches** (Entwicklungszweige). This will not touch the main branch, Later on, if you are happy with your yode, you can merge it in the main branch. Imagine it as a tree. Or parallel lines.

## GIT Flow


## States 

![[States of GIT 1.png]]


# ADD, COMMIT, PUSH

They are similar in a way. They push your files to the next stage (see picture above). 
Differences:
  - Adding: You can choose the files you want to add. If you added a file you don't want to have, do **git reset**
  - Commit & Push: Takes all the files from the current stage to the next stage.



# GITHUB

GITHUB is the place where you host the gits and make them public. So you can work on it as a team.
