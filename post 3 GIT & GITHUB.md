# GIT 

## Basic principles

It's a tool that can save your project if you messed it up. That mechanism is called "Version Control". 

You can see it as a rope in rock climbing. It can bring you back to a state you were before and start over again if you felt like you took a wrong direction. Another good picture is the "Time Machine".

You can work on multiple **branches** (Entwicklungszweige). This will not touch the main branch, Later on, if you are happy with your yode, you can merge it in the main branch. Imagine it as a tree. Or parallel lines.
