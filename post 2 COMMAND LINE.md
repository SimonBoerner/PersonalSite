# COMMAND LINE

# Shell, Terminal, Console...?

The german translation for **shell** is: "Schale" or "HÃ¼lle". It's the outer layer, so it's the the interface between the human and the machine. A shell is the program that the terminal sends user input to. The shell generates output and passes it back to the terminal for display. 

The **terminal** displays output on the screen and accepts input from the keyboard. The terminal needs another program to run that input. That programm is the **shell**. 
It's also calles command-line-interface (CLI)

The **console** (command line) is a text-based application to edit, watch and manipulate files on the machine. It's similar to the Windows Explorer, but without the GUI. 

> Technically (and historically) the **Console** is the device and the **Terminal** is the software program inside the Console.

# Commands and flags

 If you want to manipulate your computer in any way, you run commands in the CLI.
 
You can do basicially everything in the CLI like you could do with an [[Graphical User Interface (GUI)]]. For chaining commands and repititive tasks it's even better, because you can automate them.

Flags allow you to make the command more precise. For example if you want to see the the files of the directory you're currentyl in, type **ls** as command, and **-a** for "all". This will show you all files, included the hidden ones.
