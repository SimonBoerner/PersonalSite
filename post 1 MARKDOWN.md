# MARKDOWN

Markdown is a leightweight markup language. There are good reasons to use it.

- Easy to read, easy to write and fast to use. Check the [[Markdown Cheatsheet]].

- It's basicially plain text, therefore it's way more futureproof than e.g. Microsoft Words .docx files.

- Even it's just text, you still have the ability to make use of e.g. lists, tables and embed pictures via links.
